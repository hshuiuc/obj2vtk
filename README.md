 this project converts Wavefront OBJ files to VTK Legacy Format polygonal data files. Both formats have many features, but you this project only implement a specific subset.

- Reading in the .obj file and creating linked lists for the face lines shows that you know how to create linked lists.
- Writing out the .vtk files to traverse the linked lists.
- Triangularizing the linked lists for the faces, in-place.
